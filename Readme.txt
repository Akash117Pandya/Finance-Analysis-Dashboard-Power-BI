README - Finance Analysis Dashboard
📌 Introduction

Finance is the backbone of every business. Without clear visibility into revenues, expenses, and profitability, organizations struggle to make informed decisions. Finance dashboards provide a centralized and visual way to track financial performance, identify inefficiencies, and plan for sustainable growth.

This project presents a Finance Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI. It consolidates financial KPIs into an interactive interface, enabling stakeholders to monitor trends, drill into expenses, and evaluate profitability across time, regions, and departments. By providing insights into both revenues and costs, it helps organizations achieve financial efficiency.

To provide a breakdown of costs by department, region, or category.

To analyze profit margins across different dimensions.

To track financial KPIs month-over-month and year-over-year.

To support better budgeting and cost optimization strategies.
